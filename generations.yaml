generations:
  - name: "First Generation (BK)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The first-generation Mazda3 replaced the Proteg√©/323 as Mazda's compact car offering, introducing more sophisticated styling, improved performance, and enhanced features. Available in both sedan and five-door hatchback body styles, it featured expressive design that stood out in the typically conservative compact segment. Built on the Ford C1 platform shared with the Ford Focus and Volvo S40/V50, it offered significantly improved structural rigidity and driving dynamics compared to its predecessor. Powertrain options in North America included a 2.0L four-cylinder producing 148 horsepower and a more powerful 2.3L with 160 horsepower (upgraded to 166 hp in 2006), with other markets receiving various gasoline and diesel engines. Transmission choices included four-speed automatic and five-speed manual, with a five-speed automatic added later. The sporty MAZDASPEED3 variant was introduced in 2007, featuring a turbocharged 2.3L direct-injection engine producing 263 horsepower, six-speed manual transmission, limited-slip differential, and sport-tuned suspension. The interior offered better materials and design than typical for the segment, with available features including automatic climate control, Bose audio, and navigation. This generation established the Mazda3 as a driver-focused alternative in the compact segment, emphasizing handling and engagement while providing competitive practicality and value."

    description: "The second-generation Mazda3 evolved the design and driving characteristics of its predecessor while improving refinement, efficiency, and technology. The exterior styling became more expressive with a prominent 'smiling' front grille, flowing body lines, and more sculpted appearance. Available in both sedan and hatchback body styles, it maintained similar dimensions to the first generation. Powertrain options in North America included a revised 2.0L four-cylinder with 148 horsepower and a 2.5L (replacing the 2.3L) with 167 horsepower, while global markets received various gasoline and diesel engines including SkyActiv technology in later model years. Transmission choices expanded to include six-speed manual and automatic options alongside the existing five-speed manual and automatic. The MAZDASPEED3 returned with the turbocharged 2.3L producing 263 horsepower, enhanced with revised gearing and torque management to improve drivability. The interior featured improved materials, more contemporary design, and enhanced technology including an available Bose surround sound system, Bluetooth connectivity, and advanced keyless entry. A mid-cycle refresh in 2012 introduced Mazda's SkyActiv technology, including a new 2.0L SkyActiv-G engine with 155 horsepower and improved efficiency, alongside subtle styling updates. This generation continued the Mazda3's reputation for driver engagement while addressing previous criticisms regarding fuel economy and refinement."

    end_year: 2018
    description: "The third-generation Mazda3 represented a significant advancement, introducing Mazda's Kodo 'Soul of Motion' design language and full suite of SkyActiv technologies. Available in sedan and hatchback body styles, it featured more premium styling with flowing lines, a prominent grille, and available LED lighting. This generation fully implemented Mazda's SkyActiv philosophy, with a lightweight but rigid platform, efficient powertrains, and a holistic approach to vehicle dynamics. Powertrain options in North America included a 2.0L SkyActiv-G with 155 horsepower and a 2.5L SkyActiv-G with 184 horsepower, both achieving significantly improved fuel economy compared to previous generations. Global markets also received SkyActiv-D diesel engines. Transmission choices included six-speed manual and automatic, both redesigned for efficiency and engagement. The interior made a substantial leap in quality, design, and technology with soft-touch materials, available leather upholstery, and Mazda Connect infotainment system controlled by a rotary commander. Advanced safety features expanded to include Smart City Brake Support, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control. A mid-cycle refresh in 2017 (BN) brought subtle styling updates, interior refinements, G-Vectoring Control for improved handling, and additional sound insulation. The third generation elevated the Mazda3 to near-premium status in the compact segment, emphasizing design, driving dynamics, and quality while maintaining competitive pricing."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (BP)"
    start_year: 2019
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Mazda3 represents another significant evolution, featuring a more mature interpretation of Kodo design with clean surfacing, minimal character lines, and distinctive proportions for both sedan and hatchback variants. Built on Mazda's new SkyActiv-Vehicle Architecture, it introduces a torsion beam rear suspension (replacing the previous multi-link design) to improve ride comfort and sound isolation, though the enthusiast-focused Turbo model retains a more sophisticated multi-link setup. Powertrain options include a standard 2.0L SkyActiv-G (some markets), 2.5L SkyActiv-G with 186 horsepower, and a revolutionary SkyActiv-X engine in global markets that combines spark and compression ignition for improved efficiency. For 2021, a turbocharged 2.5L engine with 250 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque was added, paired with standard all-wheel drive. Transmission choices include six-speed manual and automatic. All-wheel drive became available for the first time on non-turbo models as well. The interior represents a major upgrade with a minimalist design focused on driver engagement, premium materials throughout, and reduced visual distractions. Technology includes a standard 8.8-inch center display controlled by a rotary commander, available 12-speaker Bose audio, and a comprehensive suite of i-Activsense safety features including standard automated emergency braking, available adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, and driver attention alert. The fourth-generation Mazda3 continues the model's move upmarket, competing more directly with premium compact offerings through sophisticated design, refined driving dynamics, upscale interior quality, and advanced technology, while maintaining some of the driver-focused character that has defined the nameplate."
